<h3>Why you should market pre-crowdfunding</h3><p>Think of crowdfunding as hosting a week long festival. Without pre-crowdfunding marketing it would be equivalent to opening the festival without telling anyone. Pre-marketing is building anticipation for your opening. Once the doors are open to the festival, if people like what they see then they will bring their friends and their friends will bring their friends. This wraps up the essential part that pre-marketing plays in crowdfunding. You need to build that initial pool of excited fans before opening the doors that allow them to sponsor your dream.</p><p>Marketing a crowdfunding project can be a difficult task, and it differs from normal marketing. In Normal marketing, the focus is on finding your target audience and then to run ads about your invention to this audience. Crowdfunding has another variable you must account for; you have to find your target audience but also find people interested in not just your idea but also in crowdfunding. This is one of the driving forces to why the <a href="http://Dreams.Build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreams.Build</a> platform will have a community hub that allows Innovators the ability to find their target audience within crowd funders.</p><h3>Don’t wait to launch for marketing</h3><p>Most Innovators wait until they are on a crowdfunding platform to conduct any form of marketing. While this has worked for projects in the past, it is not the best way to approach crowdfunding. This leads to a battle against time, where you are trying to market your project within the time frame of your project’s funding period. This may help you stand out on your chosen platform for a couple of days, but it is inefficient in pulling people into your project. You have effectively given your marketing a budget of time, but you have not identified what marketing methods will generate more engagement. There are steps you should take in marketing once your project is live but to make those steps easier, pre-marketing is key.</p><h3>Why Pre-Marketing is essential</h3><p>Look at pre-marketing as building hype for your initial crowdfunding release. We recommend starting early before your debut. Give yourself a two month buffer to ensure that you know what works and what doesn’t when it comes to being live. Since live will be the point when marketing is essential. Finding your target audience within the crowdfunding industry is a must before going on a platform. This helps to secure excitement and initial funding for your dream, in that you have people genuinely interested in your project. You want to gather enough of a following to keep donations towards your project steady and not just at the normal peaks in the industry (initial launch and closing). Pre-marketing will also help you get on the radar for news outlets and websites that tend to cover crowdfunding projects.</p><h3>Creative ways to market your idea</h3><p>While marketing can be expensive and most sites will advise you to spend 30% of your project’s goal in pre-marketing materials, this is problematic and honestly defeats some of what crowdfunding is about. Sure, you’ll need some professional material and high-quality imagery for your project page to drive sponsor confidence and donations. You can help reduce this 30% value by thinking of creative ways to market without breaking the bank. You could get involved in events around your area which will help spread awareness of your nifty project. You want to look into hosting on pre-crowdfunding platforms like <a href="https://headtalker.com/">HeadTalker</a> or <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/en">Thunderclap</a>. These platforms not only help for when you go live, but it is essentially free marketing to the masses. There are bookoos of other creative ways to get the word out there to grab people’s attention.</p><p>While you may try different approaches, you will start to see a trend within your following as to which aspects of your project and marketing draw the best response. Based on your marketing strategy, where do you see user engagement and where do these engagements increase? This information will be useful when it is game time, and you are in the funding stage. You do not want to spend time and effort (possibly money) on a tactic that is simply not effective in garnering user engagement, especially under a time limit.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>Pre-crowdfunding marketing is essential in finding your target audience and what is well received by them. You should never wait until just before your project launches on a crowdfunding platform to start getting the word out to people. As this may lead to unnecessary stress, time restraints, and a disoriented marketing approach. Starting the marketing process a couple of months before going live in the crowdfunding sphere will give you time to pace and digest what works in your marketing strategy and also where it needs refinement. This will also reduce stress! Let us know your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/DreamsdotBuild">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dreamsdotbuild">Facebook</a>!</p><picture>
