            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is Two-Stage funding?</h1><p>Two-Stage funding is a revolutionary new funding model. Current crowdfunding platforms support either a “all-or-nothing” funding model where if the project creator does not hit their funding goal they simply do not get their funds, or a “Supportive” funding model where projects have a goal to aim for but even if the project creators do not achieve their goal they get to keep any money they raised. What if, there was a platform that provided both of these models as a single hybrid model? Welcome to Two-Stage funding. Dreams.build is the first crowdfunding platform to introduce such a model.</p></article>]]></description>
