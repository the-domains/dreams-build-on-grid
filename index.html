Crowdfunding gives innovators the ability to seek funding for their dream idea. At its basic, it is a method of having multiple people donate small sums of money to add up to a large sum of money. For example: if you need 10 dollars for a meal. You could ask a friend for 10 dollars or ask ten friends for one dollar. The latter is crowdfunding in a nutshell. The concept of crowdfunding has been around for centuries. Today, There are different types of crowdfunding such as equity funding where equity portions of your dream are shared among contributing people. The other form of funding is a reward-based approach that differs from equity-based in that instead of giving up a portion of your dream, you keep all of your dream but give out rewards (not equity) to the people who sponsor your project.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="49"><p data-reactid="50">So, is reward-based crowdfunding for you?

As the name implies, funding is split into two stages. In the first stage, the funding is “All-or-Nothing,” this means the project must achieve its funding goal to receive funding. The second stage is all supportive funding; this means that even if you do not obtain your funding goal, you will still receive any funds (minus fees) raised. Instead of having only one phase to raise funds, you can now leverage two phases for more extended funding. The additional time gives you the freedom in how you choose to fund a project since both stages perform differently but are set for the same goal- raising funds for projects.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="63"><p data-reactid="64">Stage one is similar to funding on other crowdfunding platforms. When you become successfully funded in stage one, you will be expected to deliver the incentives of your project; keep this in mind when you set your stage one funding goal. Consider all the costs to fulfill your stage one incentives, including taxes and fees. We recommend setting a 16% buffer to your funding goal to account for taxes and fees. However, you want to keep your stage one goal as low as possible to allow for a greater chance of becoming funded and progressing to stage two.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="5" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="65"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="66"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title fx-2" data-reactid="67"><div class="System-font " data-reactid="68"><h3 data-reactid="69"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="70"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="71">What is Two-Stage funding?</a></span></h3></div><!-- react-empty: 72 --><!-- react-empty: 73 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text fx-1" data-reactid="74"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="75"><p data-reactid="76">Two-Stage funding is a revolutionary new funding model. Current crowdfunding platforms support either a “all-or-nothing” funding model where if the project creator does not hit their funding goal they simply do not get their funds, or a “Supportive” funding model where projects have a goal to aim for but even if the project creators do not achieve their goal they get to keep any money they raised. What if, there was a platform that provided both of these models as a single hybrid model? Welcome to Two-Stage funding. Dreams.build is the first crowdfunding platform to introduce such a model.</p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="77"><p data-reactid="78">Most crowdfunding projects receive the majority of their funds at their initial public release. This means that after the initial surge your project could be successfully funded but your funds would not be available until your funding period is over. Two-Stage funding reduces this issue by splitting the funding period into two stages with money transfers after each stage. The first stage will be “all-or-nothing” and is meant to garner the minimum amount needed to get the project off the ground.</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="79"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="80"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="81"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="82"><span data-reactid="83"><!-- react-empty: 84 --><h2 data-reactid="85"><a data-reactid="86">Dreams.Build on Grid</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="87"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="88"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="89"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="90"></div></section></div></div>
