  Two-stage funding is a new way for projects to receive funding. As the name
  implies, funding is split into two stages. In the first stage, the funding is
  “All-or-Nothing,” this means the project must achieve its funding goal to
  receive funding. The second stage is all supportive funding; this means that
  even if you do not obtain your funding goal, you will still receive any funds
  (minus fees) raised. Instead of having only one phase to raise funds, you can
  now leverage two phases for more extended funding. The additional time gives
  you the freedom in how you choose to fund a project since both stages perform
  differently but are set for the same goal- raising funds for projects.

### How to leverage Two-Stage funding?

Two-stage funding is a new way for projects to receive funding. As the name implies, funding is split into two stages. In the first stage, the funding is "All-or-Nothing," this means the project must achieve its funding goal to receive funding. The second stage is all supportive funding; this means that even if you do not obtain your funding goal, you will still receive any funds (minus fees) raised. Instead of having only one phase to raise funds, you can now leverage two phases for more extended funding. The additional time gives you the freedom in how you choose to fund a project since both stages perform differently but are set for the same goal- raising funds for projects.

### Leveraging Stage One

Stage one is similar to funding on other crowdfunding platforms. When you become successfully funded in stage one, you will be expected to deliver the incentives of your project; keep this in mind when you set your stage one funding goal. Consider all the costs to fulfill your stage one incentives, including taxes and fees. We recommend setting a 16% buffer to your funding goal to account for taxes and fees. However, you want to keep your stage one goal as low as possible to allow for a greater chance of becoming funded and progressing to stage two.

Most crowdfunding projects follow the trend of having high donations as soon as their project goes live and in the final days before their project closes. You can expect to receive around 70% of your funding at these two points in your funding period. To this end, you want to allow your project enough time to sufficiently reach its funding goal. Keeping in mind the bigger the goal, the longer the funding period you may need, but you want to keep stage one short enough to benefit from the opening and ending surge. Stage one should vary between two weeks and one month for its funding time. You will have plenty of time to extend funding in stage two. The main goal in stage one is to become successfully funded and then handle any additional funding in stage two.

### Leveraging Stage Two

Everything changes when your dream hits stage two. Functionality wise the mechanics stay the same, except for a change in how you receive funds. You no longer have to worry about hitting your funding goal. Look at stage two as a form of enhanced stretch funding, where any raised funds (except fees) will be transferred to you regardless of whether the stage two funding goal is achieved. This is important to note because this changes how you should approach stage two from a project structure and marketing standpoint. It's no longer about hitting your goal; that's done. Now the process is about showing what you will do after being successfully funded in stage one in order to secure more sponsors.

To maximize funding, you should change your marketing and project materials to represent stretch funding. The money you receive from stage one will be available during stage two. You should allow time in stage two's funding period to apply those funds. Sponsors will back projects they feel will deliver on their promises. Fulfilling Incentives are a great way to show sponsors you can deliver. Applying stage one funds to your project before the second funding closes, will boost Sponsor confidence and will help you gauge what stretch goals are achievable.

Since stage two has its own goal, you should set some incentives for hitting this goal. Think about offering improvements or extra features to your original project if you hit your stage two funding goal. You shouldn't limit this to just the stage two-goal. However, it's beneficial to take the extra funding period as a time to offer multiple stretch goals before you hit your stage two goal. The primary goal of stage two is to power additional funding by applying stage one funds to fulfill stage one incentives, proving you will deliver on your dream and also improve on your project by offering stretch goals.

### Closing

Learning to leverage Two-Stage funding gives you a serious leg up on the competition. Stage one is all about short term, bare minimum funding. You raise what you need to get to market and have your dream successfully funded. Similar to how projects are funded on other platforms. Stage two is about long term stretch funding. You are able to raise more funds by showing progress from stage one. The Dreams.Build platform is the world's first two-stage crowdfunding platform.
