<h3>What is Two-Stage funding?</h3><p>Two-Stage funding is a revolutionary new funding model. Current crowdfunding platforms support either a “all-or-nothing” funding model where if the project creator does not hit their funding goal they simply do not get their funds, or a “Supportive” funding model where projects have a goal to aim for but even if the project creators do not achieve their goal they get to keep any money they raised. What if, there was a platform that provided both of these models as a single hybrid model? Welcome to Two-Stage funding. <a href="http://Dreams.build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreams.build</a> is the first crowdfunding platform to introduce such a model.</p><h3>1. It allows creators to get money faster</h3><p>Most crowdfunding projects receive the majority of their funds at their initial public release. This means that after the initial surge your project could be successfully funded but your funds would not be available until your funding period is over. Two-Stage funding reduces this issue by splitting the funding period into two stages with money transfers after each stage. The first stage will be “all-or-nothing” and is meant to garner the minimum amount needed to get the project off the ground.</p><p>The second stage will be “Supportive’ and is geared towards extending the funding period for stretch goals and further marketing. This means project creators will be able to set a shorter first stage to help them get started on their project. Once they reach their minimum amount needed to bring their idea to life, they can proceed into stage two. During the second stage they will receive the money raised from the first stage allowing them to get started even before their funding is complete. This will also help creators hit their launch dates.</p><h3>2. It promotes stretch funding Stretch goals are a major component for the crowdfunding industry.</h3><p>A project that has already been successfully funded would receive the money to start working without closing their funding period. Two-Stage funding has an entire stage dedicated to prolonged funding and promoting stretch goals. Within Stage Two, project creators can start applying the money received from the first stage so they can start making breakthroughs with their project and offer stretch goals.</p><h3>3. It combats crowdfunding fraud</h3><p>There is no way to fully eliminate fraud from any industry but your crowdfunding platform should do everything in its power to reduce the risk of fraud. Taking steps to fight fraud will boost both project creators and project backers confidence, opening the way to more constructive funding. Crowdfunding has two nasty fraud schemes, project creator fraud and sponsor fraud. The project creator fraud includes fraudulent projects that can’t be achieved or to receive free money. Backer fraud includes anyone donating huge sums of money and then pulling the funds or not following through on them after the project gets funded.</p><p>Two-Stage funding combats project creator fraud by placing the “all-or-nothing” model ahead of the “Supportive” model to eliminate projects that are placed on platforms that allow projects to get any money they raise regardless of hitting their goal or not. Two-Stage funding combats Sponsor fraud by providing two stages of funding. In the unfortunate event that your project is attack, the two stage funding allows you to regroup in the second stage. In contrast, non Two-Stage funding platforms do not provide this protection.</p><h3>Closing remarks</h3><p>It’s been over four years since the crowdfunding industry has restructured their views on how projects should receive funding, it is time for a change. Two-Stage funding is changing how we fund projects forever.
