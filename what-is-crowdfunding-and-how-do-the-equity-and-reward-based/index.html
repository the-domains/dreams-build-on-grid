Crowdfunding gives innovators the ability to seek funding for their dream idea. At its basic, it is a method of having multiple people donate small sums of money to add up to a large sum of money. For example: if you need 10 dollars for a meal. You could ask a friend for 10 dollars or ask ten friends for one dollar. The latter is crowdfunding in a nutshell. The concept of crowdfunding has been around for centuries. Today, There are different types of crowdfunding such as equity funding where equity portions of your dream are shared among contributing people. The other form of funding is a reward-based approach that differs from equity-based in that instead of giving up a portion of your dream, you keep all of your dream but give out rewards (not equity) to the people who sponsor your project.</p><p>So, is reward-based crowdfunding for you? To tackle this, you must ask yourself three important questions.</p><h3>1. Is there a platform that best fits how I want to raise funds for my project?</h3><p>Crowdfunding is not a cakewalk such as you post it they will come. Crowdfunding is as rewarding as it is overwhelming. If you have a solid game plan and are willing to put in the extra work needed, then you will discover greater success. People will sponsor a project if they know you have your act together and can prove that you can deliver.</p><p>You need to have a well ironed out game plan to follow before and after crowdfunding. It is also important to handle some pre-crowdfunding marketing. This will help you stand out from the crowd when your project goes live for funding.</p><p>Part of this game plan is to pick the right platform for your idea. There are numerous platforms to pick from, so pick the right one for your dream. There are platforms that focus on specific niche markets and have features geared for those markets. This is great if you have a defined market and have determined who wants what you are offering. Keep in mind that niche platforms do not receive the same daily traffic as a general crowdfunding platform that tries to appeal to all projects.</p><p>There are also platforms that try to appeal to all projects at the expense of custom tailored features. While these platforms may generate more traffic to your idea, it is also easy to get swallowed up in the sea of projects. Therefore, picking the right platform is more than just going with brand name it is more about what will benefit you the most.</p><h3>2. Do I have the marketing for crowdfunding?</h3><p>As we mentioned, it is easy to drown in the sea of projects on major platforms. To increase your chances of being discovered and funded, it is important to run pre-crowdfunding marketing campaigns. You will gain a following while funding, but it is wise to build up initial hype for your release to ensure you stay visible on saturated platforms. Often this is overlooked, and innovators simply use crowdfunding as their initial marketing. While this is possible, it is not ideal and may affect your funding in a negative manner. If you are willing to pre-market and generate a crowdfunding marketing plan, you are on your way to a profitable crowdfunding project.</p><h3>3. Do I need to raise a crowdfunding friendly amount?</h3><p>The unspoken limit of crowdfunding is one you may not expect, the funding goal. While not unheard of a project may receive a million dollars from backers, very few projects generate this amount. If your dream/project needs over a million dollars to be successfully funded then it would be wise to look at other alternatives such as equity crowdfunding or venture capitalist funding. If your idea needs less than one million dollars, then you have a stronger chance of hitting your intended funding goal. Remember that you are raising money from multiple sources who will donate a fraction of what you need. The higher the funding amount needed, the harder it will be to achieve.</p><h3>Closing remarks</h3><p>Once you can tackle those three questions, you should seriously consider reward-based funding as an avenue for funding. The crowdfunding scene is full of successful projects which also tackled these questions. Yours could be next.</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to our team with further inquiries via social media on <a href="https://twitter.com/DreamsdotBuild">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dreamsdotbuild">Facebook</a>!</p><picture>
